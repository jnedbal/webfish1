Expand the webfish.1.0.tar.gz file into a preferred directory:
       tar xzf webfish.1.0.tar.gz
A directory webfish.1.0 is created. It contains all the necessary code and an example code.

To run the program successfully, number of dependencies must be met:

Operating system:
       MAC OS X 10.5 or Ubuntu 10.10 were tested, but other versions of MAC OS X or Linux
       should be supported as long as shell commands awk, grep, sed and wc are available.
MATLAB interpreter:
       The code was tested with Mathworks Matlab R2011a with Bioinformatics Toolbox.
       Other Matlab versions should be supported but without any guarantee.

NCBI BLAST:
       NCBI BLAST 2.2.21 needs to be installed and functional. Other versions were not
       tested but may be supported without any guarantee. The path to the 'megablast'
       executable must be provided in the webfish.m file.

Primer3:
       Primer3 1.1.4 needs to be installed and functional. Other versions were not
       tested but may be supported without any guarantee. The path to the 'primer3_core'
       executable must be provided in the <primer3_dir> tag of the configuration file.

Formatted genome database:
       Formatted genome database. A raw genome database can be obtained from
       ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/. The database required to run the attached example is
       available at ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-64/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/. Download
       it and format it using 'formatdb' included with NCBI BLAST:
             formatdb -i input_fasta_file -p F -o T
       Save the files in a directory and include this directory in the configuration file
       "tasks/ABCDEFGHxy.conf" <organism> tag replacing spaces with underscores. For 
       instance, if the tag is <organism>homo sapiens</organism>, the directory containing
       the formated chromosomal sequences must be called "homo_sapiens".

Example run:
       * Install all the necessary software.
       * In the ./tasks/ACBDEFGHxy.conf file change the <primer3_dir> tag content on line
         143 to the path leading to the primer3_core executable on your computer.
       * In the ./webfish.m file on line 51 change the blast_dir to the path of the NCBI
         megablast excecutable
       * In the ./webfish.m file on line 57 change the genomes_dir to the path containing
       	 the directories with the formated genome databases. For instance if the formatted
	 databases are in the directory "./genomes/homo_sapiens/" it should say:
	 genomes_dir = '/genomes/';.
       * Run MATLAB.
       * Change to the directory containing webfish.m and execute it.
       * Results will appear in the folder ./tasks/ACBDEFGHxy/
